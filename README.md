# LiveLink Aerospace Recruitment

Well done finding this repository!  Please let us know if you discovered this during you interview preparation so we can commend your efforts.  In return, feel free to have a nosey around the repository and familiarise yourself some of the code you may be asked about during your technical interview!

There are no gotchas here and we deliberately do not have a mark scheme nor a list of what we think is worth discussing.  We will simply talk about different aspects of the code, potential problems, improvements, etc.  I am not looking for a perfect solution, but rather a demonstration of your thought process and how you approach problems.
